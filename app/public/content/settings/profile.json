  "bio": "I'm Angole Sharif Abubakar, a Certified Virtual Assistant and AI Tools Expert through ALX, currently pursuing Computer Science at Busitema University while deepening my skillset in Data Science and Cybersecurity. I specialize in designing intelligent systems that simplify workflows, scale businesses, and solve real-world problems through automation, creative design, and strategic implementation. My work merges technical precision with human-centered thinking: from building AI-powered dashboards and responsive portfolios to integrating scalable authentication systems using Firebase and Supabase. Whether it's client automation, full-stack development, or project coordination, I create digital experiences that adapt and evolve. I believe tech should be beginner-friendly, strategic, and socially impactful, and I'm committed to building tools that reflect that mission.",
